## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser with PWA support
- Local web server (for testing service workers)

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the project**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd shoppwa
   ```

2. **Serve the application**
   You need to serve the files through a web server (not file://) for service workers to work:

   **Option A: Python**
   ```bash
   # Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Python 2
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
   ```

   **Option B: Node.js**
   ```bash
   npx serve .
   ```

   **Option C: PHP**
   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

3. **Open in browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

### PWA Installation
1. Open the app in a compatible browser
2. Look for the "Install" banner or browser prompt
3. Click "Install" to add to your home screen
4. The app will now work like a native application

## 🔧 Configuration

### Service Worker
The service worker (`sw.js`) implements several caching strategies:
- **Precaching**: Essential files cached on install
- **Network First**: API calls and dynamic data
- **Cache First**: Static assets like images and CSS
- **Offline Fallback**: Custom offline page

### Push Notifications
To enable real push notifications in production:
1. Generate VAPID keys for your server
2. Update the `vapidPublicKey` in `js/push-notifications.js`
3. Implement server-side push notification sending

### Product Data
Products are loaded from `data/products.json`. You can:
- Modify existing products
- Add new products following the same structure
- Replace with API calls to your backend

## 📱 PWA Features Demonstration

### Offline Functionality
1. Load the app while online
2. Disconnect from internet (or use dev tools offline mode)
3. Continue browsing cached products
4. Add items to cart (stored locally)
5. Reconnect - changes sync automatically

### Push Notifications
1. Click the notification bell icon
2. Grant permission when prompted
3. Use the demo controls in the footer to test different notification types
4. Notifications work even when the app is closed

### Installation
1. Use the app for a few moments
2. Browser will show install prompt
3. Install and access from home screen/start menu
4. App launches in standalone mode

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Styling**: CSS3 with Custom Properties (CSS Variables)
- **PWA**: Service Workers, Web App Manifest
- **Notifications**: Web Push API, Notification API
- **Storage**: localStorage (with IndexedDB simulation)
- **Icons**: Emoji (production would use actual icon files)

## 🎨 Design System

### Color Palette
- **Primary**: #2563eb (Blue)
- **Secondary**: #10b981 (Green)
- **Accent**: #f59e0b (Amber)
- **Error**: #ef4444 (Red)

### Typography
- **Font Family**: Inter, system fonts
- **Scale**: CSS custom properties for consistent sizing

### Responsive Breakpoints
- **Mobile**: < 480px
- **Tablet**: 480px - 768px
- **Desktop**: > 768px

## 🧪 Testing

### Browser Testing
Test in multiple browsers:
- Chrome/Edge (Chromium)
- Firefox
- Safari (iOS/macOS)

### PWA Testing
1. **Lighthouse**: Run PWA audit in Chrome DevTools
2. **Network Throttling**: Test offline functionality
3. **Device Simulation**: Test responsive design
4. **Installation**: Test on different platforms

### Key Areas to Test
- [ ] Service worker registration
- [ ] Offline functionality
- [ ] Push notification permission
- [ ] Cart persistence
- [ ] Product search and filtering
- [ ] Responsive design
- [ ] PWA installation

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Making Changes
1. Edit files as needed
2. Service worker automatically updates
3. Refresh browser to see changes
4. For SW changes, clear cache or hard refresh

### Adding Products
1. Edit `data/products.json`
2. Follow existing product structure
3. Include all required fields
4. Test search and filtering

### Styling Updates
1. Modify `css/styles.css`
2. Use CSS custom properties for consistency
3. Test across different screen sizes
4. Verify dark mode compatibility

## 📈 Performance

### Optimization Features
- **Resource Preloading**: Critical resources cached immediately
- **Lazy Loading**: Products animate in when visible
- **Image Optimization**: Using emoji for demo (would be WebP/AVIF in production)
- **Code Splitting**: Separate concerns across multiple JS files
- **Compression**: Service worker handles caching and compression

### Lighthouse Scores
This PWA is designed to achieve high Lighthouse scores:
- **Performance**: 90+
- **Accessibility**: 90+
- **Best Practices**: 90+
- **SEO**: 90+
- **PWA**: 100

## 🚀 Deployment

### Production Considerations
1. **HTTPS Required**: PWAs require secure contexts
2. **Service Worker Scope**: Ensure proper SW registration
3. **Icon Files**: Replace emoji with actual icon files
4. **API Integration**: Connect to real backend services
5. **Push Server**: Implement server-side push notifications

### Hosting Options
- **Netlify**: Easy PWA deployment with HTTPS
- **Vercel**: Optimized for modern web apps
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting with custom domains
- **Firebase Hosting**: Google's PWA-optimized hosting

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Service Worker Not Registering**
- Ensure you're serving over HTTP/HTTPS (not file://)
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify SW file path is correct

**Push Notifications Not Working**
- Check if notifications are blocked in browser
- Verify HTTPS is being used
- Ensure permission was granted

**App Not Installing**
- Make sure manifest.json is valid
- Check that service worker is registered
- Verify PWA installation criteria are met

**Offline Mode Not Working**
- Ensure service worker is active
- Check if resources are properly cached
- Verify network intercepting is working

### Debug Tips
1. Use Chrome DevTools Application tab
2. Check Service Worker status
3. Inspect Cache Storage
4. Monitor Network tab for cache hits
5. Use Lighthouse for PWA audit
